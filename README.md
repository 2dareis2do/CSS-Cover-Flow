# Pure CSS Responsive "Cover Flow" and Image Slider

Forked from https://codepen.io/bjezyk/pen/rjxgqm

This is a proof of concept that demonstrates using pure css to create a
"Cover Flow" component or view inspired by Apple's original cover flow
design. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_Flow

# Using
CSS is generated using SASS compiler e.g.
```
sass scss/style.scss css/style.css
```

The generated CSS is dependent on how many slides you have. Simply modify the
number of `$slider-items` defined in `scss/style.scss`.
